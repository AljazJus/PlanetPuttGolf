        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Planet Putt Golf does not collect any personal data about the user. We save your top 5 scores you have achieved and on your local device. If you connect with Game Center, we add your top score to the global leaderboard. We also locally save the color and theme you have selected so it is easier for you to continue with the game. We don't send or collect any personal data and don't use any internet connection.
        </p>
        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>
            Because your data is stored locally, uninstalling the game or switching devices will delete your top 5 scores and the unlocked themes and colors. If any unexpected bugs occur, restart the game by closing it completely and opening it again.
